		Summer Camp Information
	</h2>
	<p>
		During our Summer Camp, your student will enjoy a summer of fun with a secret side of education.  We have different themes every few weeks to expand our studentsâ€™ knowledge.  We will start with a Carnival theme and end in the Olympics.  We take the school-age students to the United Skates Skating rink every Monday, have Food Experiences on Tuesday, and alternate between to a Book Reading at the public library or Bowling at Pin Chasers.  We like to end the long hot weeks with a Water Play for the Day when the weather allows us as well.  We look forward to seeing you this summer, hope you come out, and join our Summer of Fun 
		in the Sun!
